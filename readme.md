# psanford's pboard (atreus fork)

This is a modified version of the [Atreus firmware]https://github.com/technomancy/atreus-firmware for my custom kinesis contoured keyboard. This probably isn't useful to anyone besides me.

My kinesis contoured keyboards use a modded teensy board based on the humblehacker keyboard. My firmware was originally based on the humblehacker firmware but I eventually switched to this code base because it is smaller and easier to understand.

Besides using my custom layout, this firmware also emulates a usb mouse so I can middleclick paste in linux from my keyboard.
